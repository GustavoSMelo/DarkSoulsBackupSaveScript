Step by step guide:

Note - Be careful not to select "Yes" in the "save data not loaded correctly" dialogue bar, unless you have your backup saves in another folder.

1 - Have your corrupted backup saves on your desktop

2 - Start a new game on Dark Souls 2, as soon as you spawn in Things Betwixt quit to the main menu, but do not quit the program.

3 - Click the screen again bringing you to the main menu.

4 - Alt-Tab out of the game without quitting it and navigate to the folder C:\Users"user"\AppData\Roaming\DarkSoulsII\

5 - Go into the folder in this folder that has a bunch of random numbers on it

6 - With the game still on the main menu, take your old corrupted Dark Souls 2 saves from your desktop (should look like "DARKSII0000.sl2") and overwrite the newly created one in this folder. STILL KEEP A COPY OF THE OLD CORRUPTED SAVE JUST IN CASE.

7 - Now, go back into the still running Dark Souls 2 game, and click on "Continue".

8 - Try loading the newly created character. This should fail, and bring you back to the "Continue" menu. However now, you should see your old saves.

9 - Try loading one of your old saves. This will fail. Now go back one screen to the main menu, and click on "New Game"

10 - Once again, quit the game once you spawn in Things Betwixt, and now you should be able to load your old corrupted backup saves.
