<h1 align="center">Dark Souls Backup Save Script</h1>

<p>
    This repository is used to save my dark souls (2,3) chars, because steam doesn't provide a cloud save <br />
    I am using linux, and my games is saved in my secondary hard disk storage, so, if you wanna use my script too
    you will need to provide your own path in index.sh file
</p>

<br />
<h3>How to run this: </h3>
<ul>
    <ol>1. Clone the repository</ol>
    <ol>2. Provide your own path in index.sh file</ol>
    <ol>3. Run the script using `sh ./index.sh` in your terminal</ol>
    <ol>4. Commit your changes :D</ol>
</ul>

    This repository is not using any design pattern or good programming practices, this is a script to make my life more easier, not be something productive or be used by hundreds of clients or to be used by reference.
